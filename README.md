# PracticalApplication_SentenceEncoding

The past few years have been revolutionary time for Natural Language Processing, specifically Language Modelling. Several groundbreaking research works have been published, with each pushing the state-of-art at an astonishing pace.

Sentence Encoding is critical use case of the Natural Language Understanding model.
It helps to represent a sentence as a numerical vector, thus, making it possible to use mathematical operations on it.

The notable applications of sentence encoding are:
1. Text Classification, which has a widespread utilization for sentiment analysis.
2. Text Similarity measurements. Google recently announced that they would be using BERT in their search engine. Up to some extent, this will utilize the application of text similarity.

But beyond, text classification and applications by big giants like Google, Natural Language Models and Sentence encoding hold immense potential to impact/increase the efficiency of business processes in medium and small size companies, specifically startups.

In this project, I have demonstrated how the sentence encoding has helped to develop a system for 'Automatic Job Description Filler' for a job aggregator platform in India.
